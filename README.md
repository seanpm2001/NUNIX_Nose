# NUNIX Nose

`🧠️👃️ The Nose component of NUNIX, a set of nasal supplements and improvements. This project contains several sub-components`

> _Part of the [:octocat: `NUNIX operating system project`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/NUNIX/)_

## Summary

NUNIX Nose is a set of components to control and enhance the functions of the nose and the related nasal system. If the project expands beyond humans, snouts/muzzles will also be included.

<!--
## Debate

It is currently being debated whether NUNIX should have this much power in controlling the mind, and how this can work as a fallback. This feature, and its components may be abandoned/reworked if it is determined to pose an existential risk.

## Components

- None at the moment
- Other/coming soon
